# Simple Example for an Angular-Express-Passport App

Based on Angular-Express-Seed https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed

Uses PassportJs for user Authentication 

Has a basic example of server side authorization to show how to make the API calls accessible only to authenticated users, or only to users with admin role.

This is achieved in server/routes.js calling the middleware functions ensureAuthenticated, and ensureAdmin defined in server/authentication.js

## How to use this example

Clone the repository, cd server/, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies, and start hacking!

### Running the app

    node server/server.js

    open browser to: localhost:9000/
